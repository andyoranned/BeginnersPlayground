# BeginnersPlayground
Early simple codes for figuring out the ropes of a language 

# What IS this?
Assortment of beginner projects in mostly Java, some SQL, plus 1-2 each of the following: Prolog, Marie (assembly), and Schema. Most of it was written between 2021 and 2022. All relatively basic and commented such that you can see what is happening line by line, making it perfect for n00bs to scan over to get a feel for how to code. Bare in mind that the structure isn't perfect and mistakes were made. This also means that there's plenty of opportunity for beginners to contribute! 

# Apologies for the architechure
I am rushing to get all files backed up to format my hard drive. I tried my best to rename things in a manner that makes it easy understand what each file is while being as fast as possible.
